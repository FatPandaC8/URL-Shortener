# URL Shortener

A simple, beginner-friendly URL shortener designed for learning and experimentation.  
The goal is to transform long URLs into short, shareable links while keeping the codebase easy to understand and extend.

I make this project to learn how to talk to database, how the http works in code and how to use a framework.
Even though there's a lot more features that is still missing, and a lot of bad code. But this project has 
taught me more than i expected.
